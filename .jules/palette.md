## 2025-02-18 - Clickable badge a11y issue
**Learning:** Using a `<span>` element with `role="button"` and `tabindex="0"` creates accessibility issues because `Enter` and `Space` key presses are not handled automatically by native click listeners, making it inaccessible for keyboard users.
**Action:** Use native semantic `<button>` elements instead when an element is interactive, combined with proper `:focus-visible` styling, to ensure keyboard accessibility works correctly out-of-the-box.

## 2025-02-18 - Missing hover tooltips on icon buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like ✕) and dynamic filter chips in this app's UI used aria-labels for screen readers but lacked corresponding `title` attributes, meaning sighted mouse users had no tooltips to explain their function.
**Action:** Always pair `aria-label` with an identical `title` attribute on icon-only interactive elements to provide visual tooltips on hover.
